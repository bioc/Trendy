\title{Fit Segmented regression models on a feature/gene}
\usage{
fitSegBIC(Data, Max.K = 5, T.Vect = NULL, Min.Num.In.Seg = 5,
  Pval.Cut = 0.1, Num.Try = 100, Keep.Fit = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{Data}{matrix of normalized expression measurements. Rows are genes/features 
and columns are samples.}

\item{Max.K}{maximum number of breakpoints to consider. For each gene, 
trendy will fit Max.K + 1 models containing 0 -> Max.K breakpoints
(1 -> (Max.K+1) segments). The model with the lowest BIC 
value will be selected (unless Force.Rsq == TRUE, see below).}

\item{T.Vect}{a numerical vector indicating the time-points (or the order of samples). 
If it is NULL (default), then the time/order will be assumed to be equaly spaced from 
1:N (N is number of samples).}

\item{Min.Num.In.Seg}{minimum number of samples required to be within 
a segment.}

\item{Pval.Cut}{p-value cutoff. If the p-value of a segment is greater than
PvalCut, then the segment will be called as 'no change'.}

\item{Num.Try}{the number of different seeds to try. If all NumTry runs 
fail, then the linear regression (no breakpoints, one segment) model will
be returned.}

\item{Keep.Fit}{whether to report the fitted object (default is FALSE).}
}
\value{
Trend: direction of each sample; -1: down, 0: no change, 1: up
	Slope: fitted slopes, Slope.Trend: sign of fitted slopes, 
	Slope.Pvalue: p value of each segment, Breakpoint: estimated breakpoints, 
	Fitted.Values: fitted values AdjustedR2: adjusted r value of the model
		Fit: fit object
