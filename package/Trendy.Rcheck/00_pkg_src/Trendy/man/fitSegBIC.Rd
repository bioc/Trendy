\title{Fit Segmented regression models on a feature/gene}
\usage{
fitSegBIC(Data, Max.K = 5, T.Vect = NULL, Min.Num.In.Seg = 5,
  Pval.Cut = 0.1, Num.Try = 100, Keep.Fit = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{Data}{matrix of normalized expression measurements. Rows are genes 
and columns are samples.}

\item{Max.K}{maximum number of breakpoints to consider. For each gene, the
trendy will fit Max.K + 1 models containing 0 -> Max.K breakpoints
(1 -> (Max.K+1) segments). The model with the highest adjusted r^2 
value will be selected.}

\item{T.Vect}{a numerical vector indicating the time points. If it is NULL
(default), then the time will be assumed to be equaly spaced from 
1:N (N is number of samples).}

\item{Min.Num.In.Seg}{minimum number of samples required to be within 
a segment.}

\item{Pval.Cut}{p-value cutoff. If the p-value of a segment is greater than
PvalCut, then the segment will be called as 'no change'.}

\item{Num.Try}{the number of different seeds to try. If all NumTry runs 
fail, then linear regression (no breakpoints, one segment) model will
be returned.}

\item{Keep.Fit}{whether report the fitted object (default is FALSE).}
}
\value{
id.sign: direction of each sample; -1: down, 0: no change, 1: up
	slp: fitted slopes, slp.sign: sign of fitted slopes, 
	slp.pval: p value of each segment, bp: estimated breakpoints, 
	fitted: fitted values radj: adjusted r value of the model
		fit: fit object
